<h3>Array or List in Python
<h6>An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. In Python it is called List.
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

<h3>Complexity of an algorithm
<h6>Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size (n).
<h4>Types of complexity
<h6>  1. Time Complexity
      2. Space Complexity
